/**
 * You're given a list of n integers arr, which represent elements in a queue (in order from front to back).
 * You're also given an integer x, and must perform x iterations of the following 3-step process:
 * Pop x elements from the front of queue (or, if it contains fewer than x elements, pop all of them)
 * Of the elements that were popped, find the one with the largest value (if there are multiple such elements,
 * take the one which had been popped the earliest), and remove it
 * For each one of the remaining elements that were popped (in the order they had been popped), decrement its value
 * by 1 if it's positive (otherwise, if its value is 0, then it's left unchanged), and then add it back to the queue
 * Compute a list of x integers output, the ith of which is the 1-based index in the original array of the element
 * which had been removed in step 2 during the ith iteration.
 * Signature
 * int[] findPositions(int[] arr, int x)
 * Input
 * x is in the range [1, 316].
 * n is in the range [x, x*x].
 * Each value arr[i] is in the range [1, x].
 * Output
 * Return a list of x integers output, as described above.
 * Example
 * n = 6
 * arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 * x = 5
 * output = [5, 6, 4, 1, 2]
 * The initial queue is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5] (from front to back).
 * In the first iteration, the first 5 elements are popped off the queue, leaving just [5]. Of the popped elements,
 * the largest one is the 4, which was at index 5 in the original array. The remaining elements are then decremented
 * and added back onto the queue, whose contents are then [5, 0, 1, 1, 2].
 * In the second iteration, all 5 elements are popped off the queue. The largest one is the 5, which was at index 6
 * in the original array. The remaining elements are then decremented (aside from the 0) and added back onto the queue,
 * whose contents are then [0, 0, 0, 1].
 * In the third iteration, all 4 elements are popped off the queue. The largest one is the 1, which had the initial
 * value of 3 at index 4 in the original array. The remaining elements are added back onto the queue, whose contents
 * are then [0, 0, 0].
 * In the fourth iteration, all 3 elements are popped off the queue. Since they all have an equal value,
 * we remove the one that was popped first, which had the initial value of 1 at index 1 in the original array.
 * The remaining elements are added back onto the queue, whose contents are then [0, 0].
 * In the final iteration, both elements are popped off the queue. We remove the one that was popped first,
 * which had the initial value of 2 at index 2 in the original array.
