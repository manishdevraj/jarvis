/**
 * You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest
 * overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.
 *
 * However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger player has a strictly
 * higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between players of the same age.
 *
 * Given two lists, scores and ages, where each scores[i] and ages[i] represents the score and age of the ith player,
 * respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: scores = [1,3,5,10,15], ages = [1,2,3,4,5]
 * Output: 34
 * Explanation: You can choose all the players.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: scores = [4,5,6,5], ages = [2,1,2,1]
 * Output: 16
 * Explanation: It is best to choose the last 3 players. Notice that you are allowed to choose multiple
 * people of the same age.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: scores = [1,2,3,5], ages = [8,9,10,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: It is best to choose the first 3 players.
