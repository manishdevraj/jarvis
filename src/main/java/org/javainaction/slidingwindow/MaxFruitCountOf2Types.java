/**
 * Given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree, you are given two baskets and your goal
 * is to put maximum number of fruits in each basket. The only restriction is that each basket can have only one type
 * of fruit.
 *
 * You can start with any tree, but once you have started you can’t skip a tree. You will pick one fruit from each
 * tree until you cannot, i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
 *
 * Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both the baskets.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
 *
 * Problem 1: Longest Substring with at most 2 distinct characters
 *
 * Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with at most two distinct characters.
 *
 * Solution: This problem is exactly similar to our parent problem.
 * @see LongestSubstringKDistinct
