/**
 * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as objects,
 * hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
 *
 * The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also consists
 * of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
 * Output: [0 0 1 1 2]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
 * Output: [0 0 1 2 2 2 ]
 *
 * Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs
 * come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.
 *
 * Do this in linear time and in-place.
 *
 * For example, given the array ['G', 'B', 'R', 'R', 'B', 'R', 'G'], it should become ['R', 'R', 'R', 'G', 'G',
 * 'B', 'B'].
